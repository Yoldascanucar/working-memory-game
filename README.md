## WORKING MEMORY GAME


This project is a Digit Span Memory Game, developed with Java, Hibernate ORM, JSP, and Servlets, designed to test users' memory span by recalling sequences of digits displayed on the screen. The game includes multiple modes such as Forwards, Backwards, Sequencing, and Letter-Number Sequencing. It is essentially a direct digital clone of the WAIS-IV Digit Span and Letter-Number Sequencing subtests, replicating these well-known cognitive assessments. This project offers users an authentic experience that mirrors the memory tasks used in professional IQ testing to measure working memory.

## Features

Display of random digit sequences to memorize.

Multiple game modes:

Forwards (standard digit span)

Backwards (recall digits in reverse order)

Sequencing (rearrange digits in numerical order)

Letter-Number Sequencing (mixed digits and letters)

Input validation and result checking.

Session management to keep track of the current game state.

Responsive design for an improved user experience.


## Technologies Used


Java: Core application logic.

Hibernate ORM: Object-relational mapping for data management.

JSP (JavaServer Pages): For the frontend interface.

Servlets: Backend handling for form submissions and game logic.

JSTL (JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library): Used for dynamic content rendering in JSP.

CSS: For styling the UI.

Jackson Databind: Used to handle JSON operations in the backend.

## Setup

1) Clone the repository
   
git clone https://github.com/your-username/working-memory-game.git

2) 

## How to Play

Choose a mode from the dropdown menu.

Press the Start button to display a sequence of numbers.

After the sequence is displayed, enter the digits in the correct order based on the mode you've selected.

Press Check to validate your input.


## Game Modes

-Game Modes-

Forwards: Memorize and recall digits in the same order as they are displayed.

Backwards: Memorize and recall digits in reverse order.

Sequencing: Rearrange digits in ascending order.

Letter-Number Sequencing: A combination of digits and letters that must be rearranged (numbers first, followed by letters).
